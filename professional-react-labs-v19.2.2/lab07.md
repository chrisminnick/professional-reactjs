# Lab 07: Props and Containers

In this lab, youâ€™ll learn how to use props to pass data between components and how to create container components.

1. Open your React project in your code editor.

2. Create a new component named `Book.jsx` in the `src` directory:

```javascript
function Book({ title, author }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <p>by {author}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Book;
```

3. Create a new component named `BookList.jsx` in the `src` directory:

```javascript
import Book from './Book';

function BookList() {
  const books = [
    { title: 'React for Beginners', author: 'Chris Minnick' },
    { title: 'Advanced React', author: 'John Doe' },
  ];

  return (
    <div>
      {books.map((book, index) => (
        <Book key={index} title={book.title} author={book.author} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

export default BookList;
```

4. Import and use the `BookList` component in your `App.jsx` file:

```javascript
import BookList from './BookList';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to React Bookstore</h1>
      <BookList />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

5. Run your application and verify that the list of books is displayed correctly.

Your application should now display the book list with props being passed correctly:

6. Experiment with adding more books to the `books` array in `BookList.jsx`.
