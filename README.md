# Professional ReactJS (Admin)

Source materials and build scripts for the Professional ReactJS course by Chris Minnick.

This repository uses the shared markdown â†’ PDF build system, just like the other courses in this monorepo.

## Build outputs

- PDFs are generated from the markdown directories:
  - `professional-react-slides-<version>/`
  - `professional-react-labs-<version>/`
- Built files and course assets are written to either:
  - A sibling `professional-reactjs-public/` repo if it exists next to this folder, or
  - A local `dist/` directory here.

## Generate PDFs and prepare public artifacts

1.  Ensure Python 3 is installed and the shared `pdf-generator` exists at the repo root.
2.  From this folder, run:

    - Install nothing required; simply run the build script:

            npm run build

    The script will:

    - Clean the distribution folder
    - Generate PDFs for Slides and Labs
    - Copy `setup-test/`, `demos/`, `starter/`, `solutions/`, and `solutions-typescript/`
    - Create `labs/` and `labs-typescript/` placeholders with README.md files

## To Test Whether Your Computer is Set Up Correctly

1.  Change the current directory to `setup-test`.

        `cd setup-test`

1.  Install the dependencies.

    `npm install`

1.  Run the test script.

    `npm test`

If the tests pass, you're ready to move on.
