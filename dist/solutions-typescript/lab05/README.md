# Asteroids

Using only JavaScript, call NASA's API and create a visualization of the near Earth asteroids. We access size, speed, distance, and hazardousness from NASA to create each asteroid. Click on the asteroids to save Earth!

This software was designed for WatzThis? as an educational lab to explore JavaScript functions and API calls. This lab purposefully does not include any JavaScript libraries.

To run the software and save the Earth, clone the repository.

In the terminal, type:

``open index.html``

There, you will see an image of Earth. To the right, you will see the asteroids for a given date.
Click on each asteroid to destroy it!

To find asteroids closest to Earth on a different date, open ``asteroids.js``
Enter the date as a string in the variable 'date'

``var date = "your-date"``

BOOM!!
